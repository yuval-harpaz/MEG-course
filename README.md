==========

MEG course at Bar Ilan University, Israel. using mainly FieldTrip and SAM beamforming.
This repo has HTML pages with scripts and figures. go to: http://yuval-harpaz.github.io/MEG-course


Our Magnetoencephalograph is 4D-Neuroimaging with 248 magnetometers.
The course contains matlab scripts for analyzing MEG data.
SAM beamforming is not matlab and the software is not free (obtained from NIMH).
These dependencies are other repositories I have: ft_BIU, cleanMEG_BIU, SAM_BIU, vsMovies, work-drafts. AFNI matlab library is another dependency, important for vsMovies. get it from AFNI website.
